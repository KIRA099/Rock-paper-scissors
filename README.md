Project Overview
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where a player competes against the computer. The game keeps track of scores and provides a visual representation of the results using matplotlib.

Repository Structure
rock-paper-scissors/
├── main.py          # Main game script
├── README.md        # Project documentation

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors.git
cd rock-paper-scissors
Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt file with:

matplotlib>=3.0.0
numpy>=1.0.0
Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions:

Enter 1 for Rock

Enter 2 for Paper

Enter 3 for Scissors

Enter 0 to exit the game

Enter 4 to view a bar chart of current scores

Git Workflow
Initialize git repository:

bash
git init
Add files to staging:

bash
git add .
Commit changes:

bash
git commit -m "Initial commit - Rock Paper Scissors game"
Connect to remote repository (if needed):

bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors.git
Push changes:

bash
git push -u origin main
Branching Strategy
main branch: Stable production code

develop branch: Integration branch for features

Feature branches: feature/description for new features

Commit Message Guidelines
Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

Keep first line short (50 chars or less)

Add more details in body if needed

Example good commit message:

Implement score visualization

Added matplotlib bar chart display when user inputs 4
- Shows player vs computer scores
- Uses numpy arrays for data
Potential Future Improvements
Add error handling for invalid inputs

Implement a GUI version

Add game statistics tracking

Support best-of series gameplay
